#3) EE16BTECH11042 - Anand N Warrier

1)Python3 is used for coding
2)Libraries to install:sympy, numpy, sys
3)Command to run code: "python3 filename.py"
4)Sample Input :
for A [[1, 1],[20, 10][2, 1]] b = [50, 800, 80] c =[10500, 9000]

INPUT FORMAT
number of constraints(m)
number of variables(n)
m lines follow with n space space separated numbers
m space separates numbers(b)
n space separated numbers(c)

Input is :
3
2
1 1 
20 10
2 1
50 800 80
10500 9000

5)No need to enter non-negativity constraints(x>=0) as they are already taken care of by the code.
6 Answer for question 1 is q1_nonDegenerate.py, answer for question 2 is q2_Degenerate.py
